PRACTICAL EXERCISE
We ask all candidates to complete a practical coding exercise in order to give us a better idea of their skills and abilities.  Time is a part of this exercise - so we ask that we receive the finished product no later than 24 hours after receiving this email

====================

Description:

----------------

The task today will be to create an algorithm that ranks a set of poker hands using TEXAS HOLD-EM rules (5 community cards, 2 private cards) for 2-6 players, and then ranks those hands from best to worst according to traditional poker hand ranking rules.  If you're unfamiliar with the ranking rules of poker, below is a reference to how poker hands are ranked.

Note: You do not need to code any support beyond the ranking of the hands after being dealt, such as any betting functionality.  

Requirements

-------------------

Please construct your algorithm using PHP5, and use an OOP approach.  Include documentation. 

The script should be able to be placed on a web server and executed free of notices, warnings, or errors (with E_ALL enabled).  Alternatively, the script could be designed to be executed from the command line.

Unit testing is encouraged as well.
