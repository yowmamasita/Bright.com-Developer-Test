Project title: bright-poker

The task today will be to create an algorithm that ranks a set of poker hands using TEXAS HOLD-EM rules (5 community cards, 2 private cards) for 2-6 players, and then ranks those hands from best to worst according to traditional poker hand ranking rules.  If you're unfamiliar with the ranking rules of poker, below is a reference to how poker hands are ranked.
